## Technologies Used:
- HTML, CSS, JS, React.js
- AssemblyAI API

## Inspiration
Lecture recordings can sometimes be long and boring. With remote learning especially, we found it very difficult to stay awake and keep focus. We wanted a tool that would auto summarize long lectures and help us absorb information fast without any fluff!

## What it does
The web app takes in an audio or video file input and outputs a summary of the uploaded content. The file is processed using the AssemblyAI api and is formatted into a convenient text file. 

## How we built it
We developed the web app using HTML, CSS, the React.js library and the functionality that makes the API calls to the AssemblyAI API with JavaScript.

## Challenges we ran into
Lots of technical difficulties such as wracking our brains around how to make API calls to the AssemblyAI API and how to parse the returned JSON data. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to get our hands dirty with JavaScript and React.js for the first time while also getting experience working with an API to utilize RESTful practices.

## What we learned
We learned about the structure of React web apps, how to make API calls with JavaScript, and all about the wonderful useEffect feature (don't read our code, its abysmal). 

## What's next for Sigma.io
Additional features with different input options such as a YouTube link. Hopefully we plan to expand this to also generate flashcards from the summarized notes and do more with the data.
